Shortest Path With Negative Edge<br>
Author:  Han Liu and Xueyan Xie
</H2>

<EM>Abstract:</EM>  We have seen Dijkstra's algorithm to compute the shortest path in a weighted
graph. However, Dijkstra's algorithm fails when it comes to paths containing negative weights. 
<p>
In this extension, you will use Bellman–Ford algorithm to handle graphs in which some of 
the edge weights are negative numbers.
<p>
This algorithm is discussed in Chapter 24 of our text, on page 645.
<HR>
<H2>Introduction</H2>
<p>
First, let's think about why Dijkstra's algorithm fails when negative edges exist.
Recall that in our implementation for Dijkstra's algorithm, after we extract a vertex from the Minheap,
we no longer update it since it has the shortest distance from the starting vertex.
What will happen if the weights of edges can be negative?
</p>
Here is an example.
<p>

</p>
<p>
Starting in vertex 1, Dijkstra's algorithm will choose the edge (1,2) and (1,4), relax
vertex 2 and vertex 4 and set dist(vertex 2)=1 and 
dist(vertex 4)=4. dist(vertex 2) is smallest distance, when we extract vertex from 
Minheap, Dijkstra's algorithm will relax vertex 3 and set dist(vertex 3)=2. When we extract vertex again, 
vertex 3 will be extracted. Vertex 4 will be the last vertex in the Minheap. With nothing to update,
it will be extracted and the Minheap will be empty. The shortest path we find is 1 -> 2 -> 3 with a cost
of 2. However, 1 -> 4 -> 3 has a cost of 1. So we didn't find the correct shortest path using 
Dijkstra's algorithm. 
</p>

<H2>Bellman&ndash;Ford Algorithm</H2>
<p>
Dijkstra's algorithm uses a priority queue(Minheap, in our implementatoin) to greedily select the 
closest vertex that has not yet been processed, and performs this process on all of its 
outgoing edges. 
</p>
<p>The Bellman–Ford algorithm simply relaxes all the edges, and does it 
(V - 1) times. V is the number of vertices in the graph. 
In every repetition, for all edges, if the distance of a vertex can be shortened by 
including the edge, the distance of that vertex is updated to the new lower distance.
</p>
<p>
So Bellman–Ford algorithm runs in &Omicron;(VE) time. V is the number of vertices and 
E is the number of edges.
</p>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
When the algorithm is used to find shortest paths, the existence of negative cycles 
(a cycle whose edges sum to a negative value) is a problem. In this case, there's no 
shortest path.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>
Why is negative cycle a problem? 
</p>

<p>
Because any path that has a point on the negative cycle can be made shorter by one more walk around 
the negative cycle. This means that you can always go around the negative
cycle and make the path shorter.
The Bellman–Ford algorithm can detect negative cycles and report their existence.

<H2>Your assignment</H2>
<UL>
  <LI> Update your repository as usual.
  <LI> In the <KBD>myextention.given</KBD> package of the <KBD>extensions</KBD> source
folder, find and open the <KBD>NegativeSPath</KBD> class.
  <LI> The constructor is finished for you. 
  <LI> The graph is also initialized. 
  <LI> You need to complete the method <KBD>void run()</KBD> which computes the shortest paths.
</UL>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
You also need to detect negative cycles and print the error
in the method <KBD>void run()</KBD>.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>
After you finish it, run the JUnit test <KBD>TestNegativeSPath</KBD> to see it you get it right.
</p>
To receive full credit for this lab, your solution must:
<UL>
  <LI> Pass the unit tests.
  <LI> Don't forget to detext negative cycles and print the error.
</UL>

<H2>Having trouble?</H2>
Post problems on <a href="http://www.piazza.com">piazza</a>, but do not 
post code publicly there!
<HR>
<H2>How to submit your work</H2>
<UL>
 <LI> Make sure all of your work is commited in your repository.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Note that we will run your solution against the JUnit test as it was
given to you.  If you modify that test in some way, the results you see may
not correspond with the testing necessary to receive credit.  
<p>You can always
revert any changes you make to the testing code back to what we gave you in
the repository using <KBD>Team&hellip;Revert</KBD>, but be sure not to do that
to your source code as it will wipe away work you may not have yet committed.

 <LI> Your work will be graded as of the due date for this assignment.
